This is a complete MIT App Invenotr project for an Android app that is able to connect to a web server and fetch and display Health data

Take a look at the original post for this project @ http://georgepavlides.info/ehealth-made-simple/

This version of the app has already been published on the Android Store @ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_gpavlid.iHealth
There is a test server publising random (somehow realistic) JSON encoded data @ http://ihealth.sepdek.net 

The project is compatible with the ‘e-Health sensor platform kit’
